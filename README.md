I hosted this site on github pages so it functions like a normal website

Here's the link: https://dylanpeterson18.github.io/ArtistSearch/

In order to run the code, I simply copied the path for the 'index.html' file and ran it locally. 

All of the code is in:
1) index.html - all the html
2) frontend/search.js - all the JS logic for hitting the Spotify api
3) /assets/stylesheets - css files and the logo image
